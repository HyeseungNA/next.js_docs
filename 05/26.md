# Route Groups
it's possible to break out of this pattern by creating a route group.<br/>
like this<br/>
(folderName)<br/>
The folders in parenthesis(괄호) will be omitted from the URL <br/>
Routes inside route groups should not resolve to the same URL path.


## Creating multiple root layouts.
To create multiple root layouts, remove the top-level layout.js file,and add a layout.js file each route groups.

# Dynamic Routes
A Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a folder's name i square brackets.<br/>
[folderName]

![slug](/image/image6.jpg)

## Generating Static Params
This means a fetch request with the same arguments across multiple generateStaticParams, Layouts, and Pages will only be made once, which decreases build times.
```typescript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://.../posts').then((res) => res.json());
 
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }));
}
```
# Catch-all Segments
Dynamic Segments can be extended to catch-all subsequent segments by adding an ellipsis inside the brackets [...folderName].

in Typescript
```typescript
export default function Page({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  return <h1>My Page</h1>;
}
```

# Loading UI and Streaming
with this convention, you can show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segments loads.

# what is Streaming? 
First, all data for a given page is fetched on the server.<br/>
The server tehn renders the HTML for the page<br/>
The HTML,CSS and JavaScript for the page are sent to the client.<br/>
A non-interactive user interface is shown using the generated HTML, and CSS
Finally, React hydrates the user interface to make it interative<br/>

**however, it can still be slow as all data fetching on server**<br/>
so, Streaming allows you to break down the page's HTML into smaller chunks ans progressively send those chunks from the server to the client.<br/>
Since streaming is server-rendered, it does not impact SEO
```typescript
import { Suspense } from 'react';
import { PostFeed, Weather } from './Components';
 
export default function Posts() {
  return (
    <section>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>
        <PostFeed />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>
        <Weather />
      </Suspense>
    </section>
  );
}
```

# Error

## Recovering From Errors
An error component can use reset() function to prompt the user to attempt to recover the error.
To handle errors within the root layout or template, use a variation of error.js called global-error.js
