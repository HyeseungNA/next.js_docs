# Creating Routes

inside the app directory, folder are used to definde routes.
<br/>
`page.js` file is used to make route segments publicly accessible.

# page

## Creating UI

add a `page.js` file inside the app directory and export a React component.

```javascript
export default function page() {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}
```

# Layout

The component should accept a children prop.
The root layout is a Server Component by default and can not be set to a Client Component.

```javascript
export default function Layout({
    return (
        <section>
        <nav></nav>
        {children}
        </section>
    )
})
```

Layout do not hava accestt to current route segments. To access route segments, you can use `useSelectedLayoutSegment` in a Client Component.

```javascript
"use client";

import { useSelectedLayoutSegment } from "next/navigation";

export default function ExampleClientComponent() {
  const segment = useSelectedLayoutSegment();

  return <>Active segment: {segment}</>;
}
```
## Nesting Layouts
you can use Route Groups to opt specific route segments in and out of shared layouts.

# two ways to navigate between routes
- Link Component
- useRouter Hook

## Link Component
```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';
 
export default function Page() {
  return <Link href="/dashboard">Dashboard</Link>;
}
```

### Checking Active Links
you can use `usePathname()` to determine if a link is active

## useRouter()Hook
The useRouter hook is inside Client Components.
```javascript
'use client';
 
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
 
export default function Page() {
  const router = useRouter();
 
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>
      Dashboard
    </button>
  );
}
```
### How navigation works?
This means, for certain cases, the router can re-use the cache instead of making a new request to the server. This improves performance by avoiding re-fetching data and re-rendering components unnecessarily.
