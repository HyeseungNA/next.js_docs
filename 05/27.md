# Parallel Routes
Parallel Routing can be used to implement complex routing patterns.<br/>
so, you can define independent error and loading states for each route.<br/>
you seperated code on the same URL.<br/>

## convention
Parallel routes are created using `@folder` convetion<br/>
Slots are not route segments and do not affect the URL structure.
The file path /@team/members is equal /members.


# Intercepting Routes
Intercepting routes allows you to load a route within the current layout while keeping the context for the current page.

# Route Handlers
They are allow you to create custom requests handlers for a given route using the Web request and Response APIS
## Convention

```typescript
// app/api/routs.ts
export async function GET(request: Request) {}
```
## Stacic Route Handlers
Route Handlers are statically evaluated by default when using the `GET` method with the `Response` object.

### Static and Dynamic Data Fetching
- Static Data is data that doesn't change often, like blog post
- Dynamic Data is chaging often, like shopping car list

There are two benifits to using static data<br/>
1. It reduces the load on your database by minimizing the number of requests made.
2. The data is automatically cached for improved loading performance.

### for example
```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
 
export async function GET() {
  const res = await fetch('https://data.mongodb-api.com/...', {
    next: { revalidate: 60 }, // Revalidate every 60 seconds
  });
  const data = await res.json();
 
  return NextResponse.json(data);
}
```


## Caching Data
Caching is the process of storing data in a location, so it doesn't need to be re-fetched from the original source on each request.

## Revalidating Data

1. Background: Revalidates the data at a specific time in interval.
2. on-demand: Revalidtaed the data whenever there is an update
```typescript
fetch('https://...', { next: { revalidate: 60 } });
```
