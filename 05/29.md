# static and Dynamic Rendering
In a static route, components are rendered on the server at build time.<br/>
In a dynamic route, components are rendered on the server at request time.

# Dynamic Rendering
Dynamic funcitons rely on infomation that can only be known at request time such as a user's cookies, current request headers, or the URL's search params<br/>
if you opt out of caching behavior, set the cache option `no-store` or `revalidate` to 0

# Edge and Node.js Runtimes
In the context of Next.js, `runtime` refers to the set of libraries, APIs, ans general functionality available to your code during execution

## Node.js Runtime
Using the Node.js runtime gives you access to all Node.js APIs, and all npm packages that rely on them. but, it's not fast as Edge runtime
```typescript
export const runtime = 'edge'; // 'nodejs' (default) | 'edge'
```

## Edge Runtime
In Next.js, the lightweight Edge Runtime is a subset of available Node.js APIs.<br/>
It is ideal if you need to deliver dynamic,personalized content with small, simple functions.

## Serverless Node.js
serverless is ideal if you need a scalable solution that can handle more complex computational load than the Edge Runtime.
