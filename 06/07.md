# Lazy Loading
Lazy loading in Next.js helps improve the initail loading performance of an application by decreasing the amount of javascript needed to render a route.<br/>

it allows you to defer loading of client components<br/>

There are two ways you can implement lazy loading in Next.js<br/>

1. using Dynamic Imports with next/dynamic
2. Using React.lazy() with Suspense

## next/ dynamic
next/dynamic is a composite of React.lazy() and suspense.
```typescript
'use client'
 
import { useState } from 'react'
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
 
// Client Components:
const ComponentA = dynamic(() => import('../components/A'))
const ComponentB = dynamic(() => import('../components/B'))
const ComponentC = dynamic(() => import('../components/C'), { ssr: false })
 
export default function ClientComponentExample() {
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false)
 
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Load immediately, but in a separate client bundle */}
      <ComponentA />
 
      {/* Load on demand, only when/if the condition is met */}
      {showMore && <ComponentB />}
      <button onClick={() => setShowMore(!showMore)}>Toggle</button>
 
      {/* Load only on the client side */}
      <ComponentC />
    </div>
  )
}
```
## Skipping SSR
when using `React.lazy()` and suspense, client components will be pre-rendered by default<br/>
If you want to disable pre-rendering for a Client Component, you can use the `ssr` option set to `false`
```typescript
const ComponentC = dynamic(() => import('../components/C'), { ssr: false })
```

## Importing Server Components
If you dynamically import a Server Component, only the Client Components that are children of the Server Component will be lazy-loaded-not the Server Component itself.<br/>

## Loading External Libraries
External libraries can be loaded on demand using the `import()` function.This example uses the external library `fuse.js` for fuzzy search.
