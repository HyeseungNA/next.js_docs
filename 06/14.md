# Typescript
Next.js provides a Typescript-first development experience for building your React application<br/>

To accept  `href` in a custom component wrapping `next/link`, use a generic
```typescript
import type { Route } from 'next';
import Link from 'next/link';
 
function Card<T extends string>({ href }: { href: Route<T> | URL })
  return (
    <Link href={href}>
      <div>My Card</div>
    </Link>
  );
}
```

1. you can fetch directly in components, layouts, and pages on the server
2. streamlined data flow between components
```typescript
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...')
  // The return value is *not* serialized
  // You can return Date, Map, Set, etc.
  return res.json()
}
 
export default async function Page() {
  const name = await getData()
 
  return '...'
}
```
# Passing Data Between Server & Client Components
It's typed the same as passing any other props between components

## Ignoring Typescript Errors
If you'd like Next.js to dangerously produce production code even when your application has errors, you can disable the built-in type checking step
```typescript
module.exports = {
  typescript: {
    // !! WARN !!
    // Dangerously allow production builds to successfully complete even if
    // your project has type errors.
    // !! WARN !!
    ignoreBuildErrors: true,
  },
}
```

# EsLint
There is three options can be selected
- Strict
- Base
- Cancel

# Loading Environment Variables
In order to expose a variable to the browser you have to prefix the variable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. 
```typescript
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=abcdefghijk
```

 similar to Default Environment Variables, .env.test file should be included in your repository, but .env.test.local shouldn't, as .env*.local are intended to be ignored through .gitignore.
